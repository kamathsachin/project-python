This folder contains python projects that I created while learning Python.
The project ideas are from the material I referred to for learning Python.

## Day 1 - Band Name Generator:
This project is created to demonstrate usage of print, input and string concatenation. It takes the city name and pet name as input and concatenates them to create a name that could be your band name.

This folder contains python projects that I created while learning Python.
The project ideas are from the material I referred to for learning Python.

## Day 1 - Band Name Generator:
This project is to demonstrate usage of print, input and string concatenation. It takes the city name and pet name as input and concatenates them to create a name that could be your band name.

## Day 2 - Tip Calculator
This project is to demonstrate data type manipulations and f string usage. It takes total bill amount, tip percentage and total number of people and provides the split per person.

## Day 3 - Treasure Island
This project is to demonstrate control flows with if/else, nested if/else and logical operators. Based on response from the user, the game takes different path and each path ends into a different result.

## Day 4 - Rock Scissors and Paper
This project is to demonstrate usage of modules (random), lists and how to access list elements. Based on user's choice and randomly selected computer's choice the winner of the game is declared.

This folder contains python projects that I created while learning Python.
The project ideas are from the material I referred to for learning Python.

## 01 - Band Name Generator:
This project is to demonstrate usage of print, input and string concatenation. It takes the city name and pet name as input and concatenates them to create a name that could be your band name.

## 02 - Tip Calculator
This project is to demonstrate data type manipulations and f string usage. It takes total bill amount, tip percentage and total number of people and provides the split per person.

## 03 - Treasure Island
This project is to demonstrate control flows with if/else, nested if/else and logical operators. Based on response from the user, the game takes different path and each path ends into a different result.

## 04 - Rock Scissors and Paper
This project is to demonstrate usage of modules (random), lists and how to access list elements. Based on user's choice and randomly selected computer's choice the winner of the game is declared.

## 05 - Password Generator
This project is to demonstrate usage of for loops and random functions. It takes total number of characters, numbers and symbols that is wanted in the password and generates the password accordingly.

## 06 - Hangman
This project is to demonstrate usage of loops (for, while), creating and importing modules and writing conditional statements. A random word is selected and the user has 6 attempts to guess the word.

## 07 - Caeser Cipher
This project is to demonstrate function creation and calling the functions. Based on user's input whether to encode or decode, the program takes user message and a shift number and encodes or decodes a message.

## 08 - Secret Auction
This project is to demonstrate dictionary creation and manipulation / accessing of the dictionary data. 
In this program, names and bid amounts of the participants are collected and once all participants have entered their data, the winner is declared.

## 09 - Calculator
This project is to demonstrate functions which return output and recursion. It takes 2 numbers as user input and performs an operation that the user selects.

## 10 - Capstone Project - Blackjack
This project is used to demonstrate all the fundamentals of python learnt till now. Below are the rules:

The deck is unlimited in size.

There are no jokers.

The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.

The Ace can count as 11 or 1.

The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.

Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.

The computer is the dealer.

## 11 - Number Guessing
This project is to demonstrate conditional loops, functions, creating modules and calling it. It generates a random number and the user has to guess the number based on the attempts provided. Attempts are based on the difficulty level selected by the user.

## 12 - Higher Lower
This project is to demonstrate conditional loops, functions, creating modules and calling it. 2 set of questions are generated and user has to select an option which might have the highest follower count. If user selection is correct game continues and new options are generated. If the game continues, 2nd question becomes the 1st question and a new question for the 2nd question is generated.

## 14 - Coffee Machine - Object Oriented Programing
This project is used to demonstrate OOP. In this project, the methods and attributes of various classes are provided based on which objects were created and the coffee maker was designed. Below are the requirement for the Coffee Maker:
#### 1/ Print report
#### 2/ Check resources sufficient
#### 3/ Process coins
#### 4/ Check transaction successful
#### 5/ Make Coffee

## 15 - Quiz
This project is used to demonstrate OOP. In this project, a quiz is created with the help of classes, methods and attributes.

## 15 - Hirst Painting
This project demonstrates the use of modules. In this project, we are creating a spot painting similar to the ones created by Damien Hirst
